# Toronto Crime Victim Data Analysis

## Overview

This repo serves as the hosting directory of my Toronto crime victim data analysis project which utilizes an open-source data set from the Open Data Toronto website to discover patterns, trends, and insights about crime activities and consequences in Toronto in the last 10 years.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from Open Data Toronto.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `other` contains details about LLM chat interaction and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download, and analyze the data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of the auto-complete tool, Codriver. The abstract and introduction were written with the help of ChatHorse and the entire chat history is available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.
